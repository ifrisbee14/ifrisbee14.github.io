  <div id="about me">
    <p>Hello! My name is Isabella, and I'm a GU freshman who loves learning new things and getting creative. In my free time, I enjoy spending time outdoors, reading, and drawing!</p>
    <p>Some of my favorite things include reading fantasy books, watching sitcoms and animated shows, listening to music, and sunsets!</p>
    <p>In the future, I'd love to keep improving my programming and design skills. I think it's really cool how creativity and coding can work together! My goal is to build projects that are both fun and meaningful.</p>
